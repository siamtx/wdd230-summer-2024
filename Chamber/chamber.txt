The Chamber of Commerce Project Description
Overview
The Chamber of Commerce Project is a website project that will be built throughout the course. The goal of the project is to meet the course outcomes and objectives through development specifications that match learning activities and assignments. You will select the town, city, municipality, or region, such as your home town, to be the location subject of the site. The project provides opportunities to apply the concepts by planning, designing, developing, and maintaining a website.

For background, a chamber of commerce is typically a local organization of businesses that work together to strengthen the business interests of the group. The intent is to foster business networking and to advocate on the behalf of the community and, for our purposes, advertise the attractions of the city.
